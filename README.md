# BLEiPhoneApp
BLE iPhone App for AirConditionaer

This is a project for me to control a relay with my iPhone using BLE.
On the Arduino I am wiring that up to a DHT11 Temperature sensor, a 5V relay, and a HM-10 BLE module.

You run that and open the iPhone app that I created in xCode and run the app.
